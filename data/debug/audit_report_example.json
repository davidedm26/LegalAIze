However, it lacks comprehensive adversarial testing and technical redundancy solutions, which are critical for high-risk AI systems as per Article 15. The absence of specific measures against adversarial attacks and the reliance on standard firewalls indicate potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, while the user manual warns against pediatric use, it does not prevent processing, which could lead to risks."
